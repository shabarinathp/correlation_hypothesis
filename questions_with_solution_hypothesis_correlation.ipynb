        "\n",
        "3. **What is the difference between positive and negative correlation?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: In positive correlation, both variables move in the same direction, while in negative correlation, they move in opposite directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **How do you interpret a correlation coefficient?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: A value close to +1 indicates a strong positive correlation, a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, and a value close to 0 indicates no correlation.\n",

        "180. **What is the Durbin-Watson test, and why is it used in time series analysis?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Durbin-Watson test checks for autocorrelation (specifically, first-order autocorrelation) in the residuals of a regression model. It is crucial for time series data to ensure that residuals are independent over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "181. **How does correlation affect feature interaction terms in polynomial regression?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: Highly correlated features may lead to inflated coefficients when interaction terms are included in polynomial regression, complicating model interpretation and potentially leading to overfitting.\n",

        "183. **What is the importance of conducting A/B testing in machine learning models?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: A/B testing is a type of hypothesis testing that compares two versions of a model (or feature) to determine which one performs better, allowing for informed decisions based on statistical evidence rather than random variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "184. **What is the role of correlation in detecting data leakage?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: High correlation between training and test data or between features and the target can be a sign of data leakage, where information from the test set or future data has been inadvertently included in the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "185. **How do you use hypothesis testing to evaluate feature transformations?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: Hypothesis tests can be applied to transformed features (e.g., logarithmic or polynomial transformations) to check if the transformation significantly improves the relationship between the feature and the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "186. **What is the Jarque-Bera test, and how is it used in machine learning?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Jarque-Bera test checks whether the sample data has skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution. It helps validate the normality assumption in models that require normally distributed residuals or features.\n",
        "\n",
        "187. **How can correlation analysis aid in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: Correlation analysis can identify highly correlated features, allowing PCA to better capture the variance in the dataset by combining correlated variables into principal components, reducing dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "188. **What is the Box-Cox transformation, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Box-Cox transformation is a power transformation used to stabilize variance and make data more normal. After applying it, hypothesis tests can be used to assess whether the data now meet the assumptions of normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "189. **How is the likelihood ratio test used to compare nested models in machine learning?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The likelihood ratio test compares the goodness-of-fit of two nested models (one simpler, one more complex) by testing whether the more complex model significantly improves fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "190. **What is the Anderson-Darling test, and when should it be used?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Anderson-Darling test is used to check whether a sample comes from a specific distribution, such as the normal distribution. It is often used to validate assumptions in hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "191. **What is the Wald test, and how does it apply to feature significance in regression models?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Wald test assesses the significance of individual regression coefficients by testing whether the coefficient is significantly different from zero. It is commonly used in logistic and linear regression models to evaluate feature importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "192. **What is the difference between correlation and covariance in feature analysis?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: **Covariance** measures how two variables vary together, while **correlation** standardizes covariance to a scale between -1 and 1, indicating both the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "193. **How do hypothesis tests help in detecting overfitting in machine learning models?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: Hypothesis tests can compare training and test set performance. If a model performs significantly better on the training set than on the test set, it could indicate overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "194. **What is the purpose of cross-correlation in time series data preprocessing?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: Cross-correlation measures the relationship between two time series at different lags, helping identify lead-lag relationships, which can inform model development in time series forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "195. **How does the Mann-Whitney U test compare with the t-test for non-normal data?**\n",
        "   - **Answer**: The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test, used when the data does not follow a normal distribution. It compares the ranks of two independent groups rather than their means.\n",
